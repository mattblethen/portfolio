## Overview

The previous site relied on a stock theme that limited merchandising and slowed pages under load. I rebuilt the storefront with a custom Shopify 2.0 theme emphasizing modular sections, a metafield-driven content model, and a lean asset pipeline for speed and maintainability. The result is a faster, cleaner storefront that the in-house team can update without developer involvement.

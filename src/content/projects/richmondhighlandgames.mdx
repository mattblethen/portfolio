  quote: "From top to bottom, start to finish. Matt has covered everything I needed for my website and more! From making it easily accessible for all viewers and readily available for me to gain the information I need. He gave me a website that I could be proud of, that showcased everything I wanted to present as well as well written descriptions of the annual event that I host. Matt has been there every step of the way to ensure all my needs were met, provided constant and quick communication for any changes made and delivered quick assistance with any questions I've had along the way. Highly Recommend!"

## Overview

This lightweight WordPress theme was built to do one job well: **drive event sign-ups** while giving visitors the essentials—date, location, schedule, and sponsor info.  
A minimalist component set (hero CTA, schedule block, sponsor tiers, and form sections) keeps the site fast and easy for organizers to update. On mobile, the layout prioritizes the **Sign Up** call-to-action and a simplified menu.

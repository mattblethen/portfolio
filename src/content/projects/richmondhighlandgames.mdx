## Overview

This lightweight WordPress theme was built to do one job well: **drive event sign-ups** while giving visitors the essentials—date, location, schedule, and sponsor info.  
A minimalist component set (hero CTA, schedule block, sponsor tiers, and form sections) keeps the site fast and easy for organizers to update. On mobile, the layout prioritizes the **Sign Up** call-to-action and a simplified menu.

## Overview

The inli10 Prints storefront was created to showcase visionary digital artwork through a custom Shopify 2.0 theme built from the ground up for print-on-demand.  
Unlike standard themes, this design introduces **dynamic color synchronization**, where each product page reads palette metafields to automatically set complementary button, background, and accent colors matching the artwork.

The goal was to merge **artistic presentation with technical precision** — large, high-quality mockups load quickly through optimized lazy-loading and compression strategies, while metafields handle all design logic behind the scenes.  
The result is a stunning, cohesive experience that brings the artwork to life across every collection and device.

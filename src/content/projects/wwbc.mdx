## Overview

The **Wild West Beard Co.** storefront was reimagined from the ground up as a **custom Shopify 2.0 theme** designed to replace a legacy WordPress site.  
The goal: deliver an immersive experience rooted in **Pacific Northwest identity** — balancing rugged visual storytelling with the refined feel of small-batch, handcrafted products.

Every major scent line (like *Western Breeze*, *Fresh Frontier*, *Citrus Slinger*, and *Herbal Elixir*) is powered by **metafields** that dynamically populate imagery, product pairings, and descriptions across the **Scent Showcase**, collection, and product pages.  
The build emphasizes both **brand narrative** and **conversion flow**, with features like:

- **Dynamic scent linking** between oils, balms, and combo kits  
- **Automatic metafield hydration** for shared scent data  
- **Optimized mobile navigation UX** with menu overlays  
- **Performance-optimized image loading** for lifestyle photography  

The result is a modern, scalable Shopify ecosystem that preserves the brand’s Western soul while dramatically improving usability, speed, and storytelling impact.
